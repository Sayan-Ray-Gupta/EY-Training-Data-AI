These networks are inspired by the human brain and can automatically extract patterns and features from data. Deep learning is particularly powerful for tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. It requires large amounts of data and significant computing power to train the models. In simple terms, it's a way for computers to learn and make decisions based on complex data, much like how humans learn from experience."}

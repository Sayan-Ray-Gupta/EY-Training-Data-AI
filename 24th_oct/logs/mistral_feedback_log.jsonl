The agent performs actions, receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and adjusts its behavior to maximize cumulative rewards over time. Unlike supervised learning, where the model is trained on labeled data, RL learns from trial and error, making it well-suited for tasks like robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems. The core idea is to find a policy (a strategy for choosing actions) that maximizes long-term rewards, often using techniques like Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).", "feedback": null}
